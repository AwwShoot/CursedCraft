Prototype mod: Upcycle {
reinforce tools with their higher-tier material rather than throw them away

Upcycling block to do so
    3 functions: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
    Reduce Disenchants the tool and enchants a book with weaker versions of the enchantments removed
    Reuse allows stone and golden items to be reinforced with iron, and iron items reinforced with diamond
    Recycle uncrafts the tool and gives you back some of the materials
